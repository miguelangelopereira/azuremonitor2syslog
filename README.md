Forward Azure monitor logs to syslog (via Event Hub).

(Azure Monitor)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-azure-monitor] provides base-level infrastructure metrics and logs for most services in Microsoft Azure. Azure services that do not yet put their data into Azure Monitor will put it there in the future.
